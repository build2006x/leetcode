#### it is simple sorting method of having two pointer of

### bubble sorting algorithm works by 
### repeatedly compare two elements and if need a swap means swap them and go
### do until arr are sorted 
##note that each iteration we have to minus lenght of the arr beacuse last element will be in the array 

arr = [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
point1 = 0
point2 = point1 + 1
